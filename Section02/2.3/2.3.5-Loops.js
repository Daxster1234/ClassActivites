// Follow the steps below to create a **while** loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let x = 1;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let y = 100;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (x <= y){
  console.log(x);
  x++;
}


// Now using the same variables you created in steps 1 and 2, create a **for** loops that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100

// 1) write a for loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
for (x; x <= y; x++){
  console.log(x)
}
